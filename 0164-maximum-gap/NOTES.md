let's implement a bucket sort algoritm
​
Now I think we can do 100 buckets
find the maximum and minimum element and figure out the difference
​
Maybe make the size of the bucket dynamic to the array we're given
Ok Let's make the number of elements in each bucket and the size of each bucket proportional.
​
Assuming that the array has a uniform distribution, if we have a length of 1000 and the range is 10,000, following out strategy of making bucket size and number of buckets proportional what we can do is make
